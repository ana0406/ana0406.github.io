# Peter Eisenman

*“Architecture, I believe, is necessary to mark collective memory.”*

Peter Eisenman (b. 1932) is an American architect, whose architecture is often characterized as Deconstructivist. 

His architectural and urban planning projects, and above all his long career 
in theory and education, position him “close to conceptual art” and to deconstructivism, 
with a strong experimental component and constant search for dialog 
between opposites and disciplines apparently unconnected to conventional 
architecture (for example, philosophy, semantics and linguistics).

Eisenman rose to fame in the late 1960s as part of the New York Five, a group 
that shared an interest in the purity of architectural form and besides Eisenman included Charles Gwathmey, 
John Hejduk, Richard Meier, and Michael Graves. Among his work are House VI in Cornwall, Wexner Center for the Arts 
in Columbus, Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe (The Holocaust Memorial) in Berlin, and the City of Culture of Galicia in Santiago de Compostela.
